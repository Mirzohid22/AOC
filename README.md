# Advent of Code Solutions 🎄✨🎄

Welcome to my repository containing JavaScript 🎃 solutions for Advent of Code challenges. Each day's solution is organized in the <b> `src/[year]/day[1-25]`</b> directory structure, where <b>`[year]`</b> is the specific year of Advent of Code, and <b>`[1-25]`</b> corresponds to the day of the challenge.

## Repository Structure 🏗️🚧

- `src/[year]/day[1-25]`
  - `day[1-25].test.js`: Test file for the solutions. You can run this file to verify that the solutions are working correctly.
  - `solution.js`: JavaScript file containing solutions for both Part 1 and Part 2 of the Advent of Code challenge for that day.
  - `input.txt`: Placeholder file where you should add your specific input for the day's challenge. Make sure to replace it with the actual input for the day.
